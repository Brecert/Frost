# Frost*

## Frost* is a stand-alone game with inspirations from FrostCraft

The game is an open world game with a focus on magic, exploration and finding dungeons.

The world is intended to be massive on the scale of Nintendo's "Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild".

Unfortunately the world will probably never be as detailed or expressive as any first party title like Breath of the Wild.

Instead much of it will be generated.

Generation should still be as expressive as possible however.

Dungeons will be part of the world with no switching in and out of them.

Many dungeons may not even be recongnized as a dungeon at first glance.

Dungeons will consist of puzzle, parkour and fighting segments

Dungeons will not restrict players abilities, instead debuffs applied by monster attacks will do that.

Restriction of freedom and power is a terrible feeling, especially in games where you work up to that power.

Underwater dungeons should flow and not feel restrictive or slow. This is a big cause of water levels being bad.

Everything should happen without pause or a menu, while this may be a design challenge, it should hopefully work with the magic mechanics and encourage the player to work around any issues.

Spells will be "programmed", different nodes connect together and execute based on the connection tree.

The cost of a spell will be dependent on the nodes.

Node costs can range from Mana to Materials or Durability, life or curses, anything really.

Tag system.
